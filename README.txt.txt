#I have created a simple password program that allows you typing your password within the set of rules. 
#These rules are that your password must contain at least 8 characters, 
#punctuation marks, numbers and letters 
#And you can also choose the recommended password which has been given by the program. 
#If your password would pass all test, it prints "Your password has been saved"
